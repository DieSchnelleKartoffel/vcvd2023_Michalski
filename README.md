#Results of those numbers of parameters:
distance of braking: 18,3 m,
time of braking: 2.395 s.

#reaction time for those calculations has been not taken into concidertion,
but the program itself is designed to take it into concideration if necessary.

#files distBrk.pdf and velBrk.pdf are graphs generated after running
program using listed above parameters.

#Program is based on "math" and "matplotlib" libraries! 


#TO RUN DOWNLOADED PROGRAM:

#1. Open Visual Studio Code,

#2. Open p2300566001.py file,

#3. Compile the code,

#4. Insert parameters in terminal of Visual Studio Code,

#5. After pop-up windows come with graphs, close them to continue work of program.
New graphs in .pdf files should appear in the directory where .py file was opened.
